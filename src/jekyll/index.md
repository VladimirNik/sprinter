Welcome to the Sprinter project! 
<br>
<br>
Sprinter is a tool for generating source code from Scala abstract syntax trees. 
<br>
Sprinter can be used to:

 - increase macros support in the IDE 
 - simplify macro debugging
 - generate code from transformed trees

The [Guide](sprinter-guide.html) will explain how to use Sprinter. [Scaladoc API](latest/api/index.html) can also be helpful. In [Examples](sprinter-examples.html) you can see real code that can be generated with Sprinter. Source code of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/vladimirnik/sprinter).
